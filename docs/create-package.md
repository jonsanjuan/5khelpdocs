### Creating a New Package from File Search

If you have no Active Package, hover over the thumbnail and then the ‘+’  icon on any File or the "<i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true"></i>" icon for the Asset Group. Name the package, and this will allow you to create a new Package with the selected Files added to that group.
