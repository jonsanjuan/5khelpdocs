title: Creating a Package from a CSV File
---

You can automate creation of a Package in 5th Kind by uploading a CSV file.  Simply create a CSV file containing the names of the Files you'd like to add to your package, and upload it through the interface.

---

First, create a CSV file containing the filenames of the Files you'd like to add to your Package, in the order you'd like them to appear.  The first line of the file must say "File Name".

Any Files in the system matching the filenames given will be added to your new package.
