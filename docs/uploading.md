title: Uploading and Tagging Files
---

For users with the permission to upload to CORE, uploading files is fast and simple, and can manage high volumes of data and files.  Uploading the actual files is just the first step in the uploading process. Categorizing the files is the next step.  Both are outlined here, along with navigating the Transfers Module where you can track and monitor your uploads.

## Choose an Upload Mode

There are two modes to upload files to CORE. 

1. <span class="linkStyle">Aspera - </span> This is the primary uploader and downloader of files in CORE. Aspera provides high speed data transfer solutions to send, share, stream and sync large files and data sets. * Requires downloading Aspera to your computer.

2. <span class="linkStyle">HTTPs - </span>  Is a simpler, slower, speed alternative to Aspera, and is useful in lower bandwidth wifi situations and if Aspera use is blocked by your company firewall.

![](/img/upload/Aspera-mode-off.png)

To choose your preferred mode, click the ( <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true"></i>  ) icon next to the <i class="fa fa-upload" aria-hidden="true"></i> Upload icon in the upper right corner of the Top Navigation Bar. 

![](/img/upload/Upload-select.png)

We recommend using Aspera to upload, for faster speeds and greater reliability. 

![](/img/upload/Aspera-troubleshoot.png)

Use of Aspera requires installation. When first selected, you will be prompted to download the Aspera Connect plugin.  The plugin link can also be accessed here: 

https://downloads.asperasoft.com/en/downloads/8?list

When Aspera mode is enabled, the gray Aspera logo will appear next to the Upload icon.

## Start an Upload 
There are two ways to start an upload:

1. By selecting the Upload icon in any number of places throughout the CORE platform.
2. By dragging and dropping Files into File Search

### Upload Files Using the Upload Icon

To begin uploading, 
Click on the ( <i class="fa fa-upload" aria-hidden="true"></i>  ) Upload icon in the upper right corner of the Top Navigation Bar anywhere on the site. 

![](/img/upload/upload-upload-icon-10.png)

A File dialog window will open. Select as many files as you would like to upload. To select multiple files, hold Ctrl (Command on MacOS) as you click. To select a range of files, hold Shift as you click to extend your selection. 

![](/img/upload/upload-file-picker-1.png)

Select “Open.”
The dialog box will automatically close.  
A pop-up confirming you are uploading files will appear. Select Allow.  The files will initiate uploading, and the Upload Details View will open in Upload Mode.
<span class="important"><strong>Important:</strong></span> If you are in HTTPS mode - Once you have initiated an upload, you must keep your browser window open until the upload has finished. The upload cannot continue if the window is closed.

### Upload Files Using Drag and Drop

To begin uploading using drag and drop, 
<div class="container">
    <div class="leftbox">
        <p></p>
    </div>
    <div class="rightbox">
        <img src="/img/upload/File-1.png"/>
        <span>
    </div>
</div>

1. Go to <strong>File Search</strong> in the Left Navigation Bar. 
2. Select a file from your desktop or file viewer
![](/img/upload/upload-viewer1.png)

3. Drag and drop the file(s) into one of two places:
        a. The blank white space to the right of the File Search box 
        b. A specific Asset Group 
![](/img/upload/upload2.png)
   
4. A pop-up confirming you are uploading files will appear. Select <strong>Allow</strong>. (In this image below, a file has been added to an existing Asset Group, which you can see by the “Uploading” thumbnail.)
![](/img/upload/upload-4.png)

5. When the files are dropped into a specific Asset Group, they will be categorized structurally with the same tags as the group. However, when files are dropped into the top white search area, the files must be structurally categorized in that moment.

![](/img/upload/upload3.png)

6. To structurally categorize the files, select the Tag Values from each of the dropdown menus at the top of the page.  These tags create an Asset Group name for your files.

## Where to Find the Upload Icon in CORE

The Upload icon is found throughout CORE in the following places:

1. <strong>Top Navigation Bar (everywhere on platform)</strong> - This initiates a general upload of one or more files that requires categorization.

![](/img/upload/upload-7.png)

2. <strong>File Search >> Individual Asset Group</strong> - This initiates an upload of files into the selected Asset Group.

![](/img/upload/upload-8.png)


3. <strong>File Search >> Top Tagging Bar >> Next to Selected “Production Name” </strong> - This initiates an upload of files into the selected Production.

![](/img/upload/upload-9.png)

4. . <strong>Asset Viewer Module >> Top Bar . </strong>- This initiates an upload of files into the selected Asset Group.

![](/img/upload/upload-10.png)


5. <strong>Inbox >> Package >> Top Bar . </strong>- This initiates an upload of files into the Package.

## Categorize (aka Tag) Your Uploaded Files
Files should be categorized during the upload process so that they can be found easily.  Files in CORE are categorized by their metadata. Metadata = tags. CORE is a metadata-based system which means files are stored and found according to their tags.  Files saved with the same tags are grouped together in Asset Groups.  CORE doesn’t have folders.  It has tags.  However, Structural tags organize files with the same tags under Asset Group names, like folders, so you can find them more easily. 

To categorize your files when you Upload, 
1. Go to the Categorization Panel to the right of your uploading files. 
2. Select the Domain according to the rules set by your company. Each Domain has its own set of Tag Fields for you to choose from. 
![](/img/upload/upload-12.png)

3. Start with the Required subpanel. Here are tags you must complete in order to submit the files.
        a. Fill out the required tags on this panel.  If you don’t know how to fill out these tags, please contact your team or company asset manager or Tier 1 support, who can assist you with the appropriate selections.
        b. Work left to right through each of the subpanels from Required through File Info, answering appropriately and per your company guidelines.
4. At the bottom of the panel, select Submit
![](/img/upload/upload-13.png)

**NOTE:**
- If you only need to upload your files, you can verify your work by going to File Search to verify that the files you uploaded were tagged properly.  To do so, go to File Search  for detailed instructions about finding files and the Asset Viewer section to view the files and edit their tags, if necessary.
- If you need to share your uploaded files, select Share Files. Go to the Share Uploaded Files section in Sharing a Package for instructions about how to share your files with the right people and settings.

**CORE Tip:  Save Tagging Time using “Load Last Categorization” and Templates**
When tagging many batches of files, you can Load Last Categorization or select a template you’ve saved from the folder icon to auto-populate the Tag Fields with your Tag Values.  When you have multiple Required tags or Tag Groups, this is especially handy.
![](/img/upload/upload-14.png)

**CORE Tip: Save Time While Tagging Using Duplicate Folder Structures On Your Computer**
If you upload files and they come from a folder on your computer with the same naming convention as an existing Asset Group, the system will pre-fill the tags for you in the Categorization Panel. You can confirm them before saving.  This feature is not yet available in the Top Tagging Bar for Drag and Drop.

Congratulations. You’ve categorized your files.


<span class="important"><strong>Important:</strong></span><strong> File Categorization is extremely important in 5th Kind.  The way files are categorized determines how people will find them in the system, as well as who has access to them.  If you have questions about how to categorize the files you are uploading, please contact your administrator.</strong>

### Elements of Upload Details View

When you upload a file, the Upload Details view will pop up, where you can view your files’ progress, categorize / tag your files and then eventually share your files. Below are the different elements of the Upload Details View.

![](/img/upload/Upload-Details-Panel-Step-1.png)

#### Elements of the Files Viewer
View information about your uploading files here. You can select them to apply categorization to a subset of files.

![](/img/upload/Upload-Details-Panel-Step-2.png)

2. **ID** - The identification number for the individual file.
3. **Thumbnail** - Files will display a default icon as they upload. Once they have been ingested and processed, the thumbnail will be updated to that of the File.
4. **Filename**- The name of the individual file.
5. **Categorized** - Status of the file’s categorization. There are two statuses:
        a. **Pending** - Means this file needs to be tagged.
        b. **Categorized** - Means the file has been tagged.
6. **Size** - File size of the individual file.
7. **Upload Progress** - The progress bar for each File will update as it uploads.
8. **Overall Upload Progress** - This circle shows the overall upload progress for all Files. It will update as the Files upload.

**Elements of the Categorization Panel**
This is where you categorize the uploaded Files. If no single File is selected via the Select checkbox, this categorization will apply to all Files; otherwise, it will apply to the selected Files.
**Categorization Panel Views** - 
**A. View when user first uploads**
**B. View of Domain with Structural Tags only**
**C. View of Domain with multiple Tag Groups**

![](/img/upload/Elements-Cat.png)

1. **Domain Select** - Select the Domain that the uploaded Files belong to. This must be selected in order to categorize your Files.
