## Categorizing Uploaded Files
Your selected Files will appear in the Upload Details View, where you can categorize them.

<span class="important"><strong>Important:</strong></span><strong> File Categorization is extremely important in 5th Kind.  The way files are categorized determines how people will find them in the system, as well as who has access to them.  If you have questions about how to categorize the files you are uploading, please contact your administrator.</strong>

### Categorization Panel
This is where you categorize the uploaded Files.  If no File is selected, this categorization will apply to all Files, otherwise, it will apply to all selected Files.

#### Domain Select
Select the Domain that the uploaded Files belong to.  This must be selected in order to categorize your Files.
#### Tag Group Select
Each Tag Group contains a set of Tag Fields that can be used to categorize your uploads.  Click any available Tag Group to view the Fields it contains.
#### Required Tags

The Required Tag Group will always be available as an option, and contains the Tag Fields from all Tag Groups that have been designated as Required by your Administrator.  These fields must be filled in order to submit the categorization.
#### Save Template
If you commonly use the same settings to categorize Files, you can save time by creating a template.  When you create a template, it saves all current Field settings for later use.  Click the <i class="fa fa-floppy-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon, enter a name for your template, and click <span class="buttonstyle">Ok</span> to save.

#### Last Categorization
5th Kind will automatically remember the last settings you used to categorize Files.  If you'd like to repeat your previous settings, click the <i class="fa fa-folder-open" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon, and select <span class="linkStyle">Last Categorization</span>.

![](/img/upload/upload-reset-form-1.png)
#### Field
For each Field in the selected Tag Group, click the dropdown to select a value.  Some Fields are dependent on another; if so, you must select a value for the other field first.
![](/img/upload/upload-field-1.png)
#### Add New Value
If there are no values in a Field, or if the value you want is not an option, click the <i class="fa fa-folder-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i> button.  Enter the new value, then click Save.  To cancel adding a new value, click Cancel.
