The Translations page lets you create new system dictionaries, and edit language in existing ones.  The system dictionary is the list of every single word that appears in the 5th Kind interface.  Using this feature, you can rename any word as it appears throughout the system.

Note that this only affects words that are part of 5th Kind's interface.  Changing these words will have no affect on user-generated content, such as file names or comments.
