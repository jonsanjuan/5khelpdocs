## Browse
The Browse section lets you look through for files in a way that's similar to a directory structure on your computer.  Select a Top Level Tag from the dropdown, then browse through the nested Metadata Tag values.  Clicking a value will add Search Filters in the Options panel, and search for files matching those values.  This is equivalent to selecting and applying these filters manually.

### Metadata Tag Browse
These nested tags represent Metadata values of Files.  Click the <span class="buttonstyle">+</span> next to any value to view the values nested beneath it.  Clicking on any value will add Search Filters to the Options panel, and search for those values.
