title: Searching For Files 
---

Users can search for files, assets, and packages in different modules throughout CORE. 

- In File Search, users can find individual files and asset groups through a combination of Filters in the Search Options Panel at the top of the module and the Browser Panel’s Browse Tab and Filter Tab.  Search parameters can be saved with templates for future use, and results can be sorted and selected for various needs. (i.e. Package Sharing)
- In the History module, you can see what files you interacted with recently.  Users with certain permissions can see what files accessed by other users.
- In the Inbox / Packages module, using Search, you can find packages that contain the files you seek.  For instructions on this module, go to Package Inbox >> Search section

# Elements of File Search Module

<span class="important"><strong>Note:</strong></span><strong> When searching for files, the Tags and Metadata that appear in the Search Results, Filters, Browse Panel and Tabs are reflective of what files are in the system. If Tags you’re looking for aren’t displayed in the Browser Tab or Filter Tab, then there are no files with those Tags.

## Elements of the Left Browse Panel
### Browse Panel Tab
The Browse Panel tab lets you look through for files in a way that's similar to a directory structure on your computer. Select a Top Level Tag from the dropdown, then browse through the nested Tag Values. Clicking a value will add Search Filters in the Options panel, and search for files matching those values. This is equivalent to selecting and applying these filters manually.

1. Top Level Tag Select - Click this dropdown to view Top Level Tag Values, and select one to view the nested Tags Values under it.
2. Browse Directory - The directory reflects the nested Tag Values of Files based on the Top Level Tag that you select.  These Tag Values are the Structural Tags that you or another user chose when uploading the Files. 
    - Click the + next to any value to view the values nested beneath it.  ADD PHOTO
    - Clicking on any value will add Search Filters to the Options Panel, and search for those values. ADD PHOTO
    ### Filter Panel Tab
    
The Filter Panel tab has search options that enable you to narrow down the specific Tag Values to return the Search results you are looking for.  The filter can be narrowed by any combination of Tag Fields. Only the Tags that are associated with files in the system are shown, with one exception: File Type. This list will always appear in the Filter Panel even if no files are associated with certain Tag Values.
