When you visit a website that uses Flash, you see a “Plugin blocked” message at the right side of Chrome’s Omnibox or address bar.

To enable Flash for the site, click the lock icon at the left side of the Omnibox (address bar), click the “Flash” box, and then click “Allow.”

Chrome prompts you to reload the page—click “Reload.”

Even after you reload the page, any Flash content won’t be loaded—you have to click it to load it.

To run an individual Flash object, click its Play button. To run all Flash objects on the page—including any hidden Flash objects running in the background—click the blocked plugin icon at the right side of the Omnibox and click “Run Flash this time.”

Whenever you allow Flash for a website, it’s added to the allow list—click the blocked plugin icon and click “Manage” to see it. Alternatively, you can head to chrome://settings/content/flash to view it.

Whenever you restart your browser, Chrome erases this list. If you use Flash frequently on a particular website, you’ll have to do this repeatedly.  

## How to Enable Click-to-Play Flash

Rather than Chrome automatically blocking Flash on all websites, you can set Chrome to ask before displaying Flash content.  
Unlike the above preference, Chrome will remember this setting. However, it will display a “Flash Player will no longer be supported after December 2020” banner every time you reopen your browser. There’s no way to disable this message without disabling Flash.

When Flash is blocked, click the blocked plugin icon in Chrome’s Omnibox and click “Manage.” This takes you to the Flash settings page, which you can also access from Settings > Advanced > Privacy & Security > Site Settings > Flash.

Click the toggle here to set Chrome to “Ask first” rather than the default “Block sites from running Flash (recommended.)”

Now, when you visit a website with Flash, you can click a Flash object on the web page and click “Allow” to view it.

You still have to click to play the Flash content afterward.
