* <strong>New:</strong> Filter your Inbox to only Packages you haven't viewed yet
* <strong>Favorites: </strong> Filter your Inbox to only Packages you've Favorited
* <strong>Archived:</strong> Filter your Inbox to only Packages you've Archived
* <strong>Deleted: </strong> Filter your Inbox to only Packages you've Archived
* <strong>Archived:</strong> Filter your Inbox to only Packages you've Deleted
* <strong>All Packages: </strong> Show all Packages, regardless of their status

### Package Type Filter

Select a Package Type to filter your Inbox to only Packages of the selected type.

* <strong>All Packages:</strong> Displays Packages of any type.
* <strong>Standard:</strong> Clicking on a standard package will display its contents, and allow you to view and/or download them with the comment or download panel enabled.  Users are aware of other users on this share. 
* <strong>Dailies </strong> Streamlines the experience to go directly to the first file and automatically plays all files. It will also hide all recipients from each other, so no one is aware who else on the share except of the sender.

## Search

Use the search box to search the contents of your Packages.  Searching will find any packages whose contents match the text you have entered.

### Sort Options

By default, your Packages will be listed in the order you've received them.  Select a different Sort Option to change the method by which your Packages are sorted.

### View As:

Admins and Package Managers have an additional feature located above Sort Options called View As: This pull down menu reveals users you have access to so you can view their Package Inbox. As an Admin or Package Manager you can emulate the person’s inbox. You can perform Admin functions and provide additional support to the user as well as share packages from their Inbox.
