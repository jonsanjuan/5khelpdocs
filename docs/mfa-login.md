## Google Authenticator
### Installation and Setup
If this is the first time you are logging in, you will be shown a barcode, and prompted to link the account with Google Authenticator.

### Google Authenticator Troubleshooting
If you are experiencing trouble with your Google Authenticator code and you are using an Android phone, it might be because the time on your Google Authenticator app is not synced correctly.

To make sure that you have the correct time:

- Go to the main menu on the Google Authenticator app
- Click Settings
- Click Time correction for codes
- Click Sync now

On the next screen, the app will confirm that the time has been synced, and you should now be able to use your verification codes to sign in. The sync will only affect the internal time of your Google Authenticator app on your Android phone, and will not change your device's Time and Date settings.

### Logging In

After your account has been added to Google Authenticator, you will need to enter the 6 digit code from it each time you log in. The code changes every :30, so make sure to enter the current code. The code turns RED to warn you that it will change soon.

### SSO Authentications

Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits an end user to enter one set of login credentials (such as a name and password) and be able to access multiple applications. Your company policy may require you to utilize SSO.
