## Accessing Asset Details
To access the Asset Details tab, click the <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon in the upper right hand corner of the Viewer.
The tab will show you every Metadata field that has been set for the File or Files you are viewing, and the values that have been set.  If you are viewing multiple Files, the fields have the same values will display those values, and fields that have multiple values will indicate that.  If several Files are selected, the tab will show fields that apply to those Files.

## Editing Asset Details
To edit Asset Details, click the <i class="fa fa-pencil-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon in the tab.

<span class="important">Important: </span>the ability to edit the categorization of Files requires special Permissions.  If you need the ability to edit File categorization, please contact your 5th Kind administrator.
Changing the way Files are Categorized may cause them to move out of their current place in the system, and into a different Asset Group.  It may also change who has access to them.  Contact your 5th Kind administrator if you have questions regarding this.

#### Domain Select
Select the Domain that the uploaded Files belong to.  This must be selected in order to categorize your Files.

#### Required Tags

The Required Tag Group will always be available as an option, and contains the Tag Fields from all Tag Groups that have been designated as Required by your Administrator.  These fields must be filled in order to submit the categorization.
#### Save Template
If you commonly use the same settings to categorize Files, you can save time by creating a template.  When you create a template, it saves all current Field settings for later use.  Click the <i class="fa fa-floppy-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon, enter a name for your template, and click <span class="buttonstyle">Ok</span> to save.

5th Kind will automatically remember the last settings you used to categorize Files.  If you'd like to repeat your previous settings, click the <i class="fa fa-folder-open" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon, and select <span class="linkStyle">Last Categorization</span>.
